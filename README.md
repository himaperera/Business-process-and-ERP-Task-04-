University Admission Management System - ERP Project

This repository contains the Figma UI/UX prototype for a comprehensive University Admission Management System. This project was developed for the Business Process and ERP module, demonstrating the flow of a student's journey from initial application to final enrollment and e-learning access.

Figma Prototype Workflow

The system is designed as a step-by-step process, guiding the applicant through each stage of admission.

1. Initial Application & Registration

Page 1: Home / Landing Page (Frame 30)
Purpose: This is the main "Start Your Journey" landing page for the NSBM Admission Portal.
Function: It welcomes potential students and provides a clear "Start Now" call-to-action to begin the application.

Page 2: Application Form (Frame 51)
Purpose: To capture the applicant's core information.
Function: A detailed form where the user inputs personal details such as Full Name, NIC/Passport, Date of Birth, Gender, and contact information (Email, Mobile, Address).

2. Examination & Eligibility

Page 3: Application Status - Eligible for Exam (Frame 78)
Purpose: To inform the applicant of their successful initial registration.
Function: This status page confirms that the application has been reviewed and the student is "EligSIBLE for Exam." It also provides a link to download the exam planner.

Page 4: Online Exam Portal (Desktop - 1)
Purpose: To conduct the online entrance examination.
Function: A simple, timed interface for the "NSBM Green University Entrance Exam." It displays the applicant's details and provides text boxes for them to answer the exam questions.

3. Document Submission

Page 5: Application Status - Congratulations (Frame 30 - variation 1)
Purpose: To notify the applicant of a successful exam result.
Function: A "Congratulations!" screen that confirms the applicant has passed the exam and directs them to the next step: document upload.

Page 6: Document Upload (Frame 41)
Purpose: To collect all necessary verification documents.
Function: This page features a "Required Document Checklist" (e.g., Birth Certificate, O/L Certificate, A/L Certificate). Users can upload their documents, and the interface tracks the status of each item (Pending, Uploaded, Submitted).

Page 7: Submission Status - Successful (Frame 30 - variation 2)
Purpose: To confirm that all documents have been received.
Function: A confirmation page that states "Submitted Successfully," reassuring the applicant that this stage is complete.

4. Payment & Final Enrollment

Page 8: Payment Process (Desktop - 4)

Function: A secure payment gateway form where the applicant enters their card details (Card Holder Name, Card Number, Expiry, CVC) to pay the "NSBM Admission Registration" fee.

Page 9: Payment Status - Successful (Frame 34)
Purpose: To confirm a successful transaction.
Function: A clear "Payment Successfully" confirmation screen, completing the financial part of the admission process.

Page 10: Student E-Learn Dashboard (Desktop - 5)
Purpose: To serve as the applicant's new hub as an enrolled student.
Function: After payment is confirmed, the user is granted access to the "E-LEARN" dashboard. This portal shows their student profile (Name, Student ID, Faculty) and provides key links to academic resources like "Go to Moodle," "Attendance Sheet," and "Events."
